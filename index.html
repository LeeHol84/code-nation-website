        <p> About<br><br> Hi, welcome to my website and thanks for giving it a look. My site is for fellow book enthusiasts. If like me you're always on the look out for the next great read or maybe you're interested in what books are being adapted to tv and film at the moment, then you've come to the right place! We also have a sign up and discussions page so if you want to let everyone know what's on your mind in the world books or just in general(PG-13 please), please get involved. <br><br> Lee  - </p>
